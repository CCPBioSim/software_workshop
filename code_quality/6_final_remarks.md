# Final Remarks

All of the tools you have learned about today are used around the world by software development experts to simplify the mundane tasks associated with writing very high quality code.

All of the tools in this workshop of course have much more advanced features than we have explored today, and you should be encouraged to step into the documentation for those tools to have a look.

We have not covered the use of these tools with github which is an online software repository platform that is designed to share your software in a distributed fashion. All of the tools in this workshop are useable with github via github actions, and once you are on github you should not only be running these tools locally on your computer like you have today, but also using them to gate-keep the quality of code accepted onto your github repository via pull-requests. There is plenty of information on the github knowledge-base on how this is done.

Finally, you are encouraged to pick up and make use of these tools in your everyday projects involving code, not only do they improve your code for you, but you will also learn to write code that is compliant with these systems over time and as a result, vastly increase your skill. Perhaps as an final incentive, most modern careers at the scientific, data science and scientific software engineering will require some base skills in these technologies.
